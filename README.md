# Portfolio

## Description

This is a personal portfolio page to showcase a developers for potential employment. The goals of this project were to make the page from scratch, with no starter code, along with completing the following tasks: 

	1. Provide developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
	2. Provide a responsive layout that adapts to any viewport.
	3. The application sample photos should be responsive, featured when clicked, and linked.
	4. Ensure all links are working. This includes anchor links to jump sections on the page, as well as links to external sites and a pdf document.
	5. Ensure the code is clean, properly commented, and follows a logical order.

By meeting these goals, this webpage will showcase the work in a clear, professional manner, be responsive to adapt to differenct devices, and the code is easy to read and understand. I learned more about writing code, CSS styling (especially using flex-boxes, hover, and overlays), and differnet ways to hyperlink. I look forward to continuing to develop this site over the coming months and adding more work as it is created.
